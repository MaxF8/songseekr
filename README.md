# spotnfind

This is a project I designed to help users find musical information about their music in Spotify quickly. 

I used React, Node JS, and Material UI to create the application and Heroku to deploy.

If you would like to access this project on your device follow the following instructions:

- Create a spotify developer account, go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login and create an app
- Install react, node JS and all dependencies included in both client/package.json and package.json
- Replace clientID and clientSecret fields with your own or create environment vaiables for them
- If you deploy with heroku, replace baseURL and redirectURI with "your-app.herokuapp.com"
